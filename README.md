# Maximum-A-posteriori-Estimation-for-Linear-regression
Welcome to the Maximum-A-posteriori-Estimation-MAE-for-Linear-Regression- wiki! In this repo we will implement MAE for simple linear regression We will illustrate why the error function MSE ( mean square error ) was written in such way we will how to apply Bayes rule in machine learning make sure to read illustration file and have fun
